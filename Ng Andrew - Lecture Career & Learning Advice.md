## Building your knowledge on a certain area/topic
1. Compile a list of papers (research papers, blog posts, etc.)
2. Skip around list, read all sources for ~10%, and find the crucial sources.
3. Read the crucial sources more thoroughly, look at the references and add them to your reading list. 
4. Move back and forth on your reading list. 

Rough guidelines:
* If you read 5 - 20 papers you will have a basic understanding of an area. Good enough to start implementing it.
* If you read 50 - 100 papers you will have a very good understanding of an area. Now you're ready to perform research on this topic.

## How to read a research paper

### Take multiple passes through the paper:
1. Read the title, abstract, figures and figure captions. 
2. Read more carefully the intro and conclusions. Take a closer look at the figures. And skim the rest of the paper, but skip the related work section.
3. Read the complete paper, but skip the math. 
4. Read the complete paper, skip the parts that do not make sense. And try to understand the math, rederiving the math yourself from scratch is a very good practice. Also, download the code if available or implement the algorithm from scratch to thoroughly understand the architecture.

It doesn't matter if there are parts that do not really make sense. Especially for cutting-edge research, it can be unclear to the authors which topics are really relevant and which aren't. Therefore, you might encounter parts in a research paper that later on appeared to be not so relevant/important.

### When you're reading a research paper, try to answer these questions: 
1. What did the authors try to accomplish?
2. What were the key elements of the approach?
3. What can you use yourself?
4. What other references do you want to follow?

### Example:
[Huang, G., Liu, Z., Van Der Maaten, L., & Weinberger, K. Q. (2017). Densely connected convolutional networks. In  _Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition_  (pp. 4700-4708).](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)

* The paper is almost completely summarized in a few figures, figure 1 and 2 convey roughly 80% of the idea of the paper. 
* Table 1 is a very common format to describe a model architecture. Such tables might look complicated at first, but the more you encounter them, the easier they are to understand, since the format it always roughly the same.

## How to navigate a career in Machine Learning

### How to get a position/job offer?
* Recruiters look for: skills (ML & coding), meaningful work (practical implementation of theory).
* A very common pattern for successful AI/ML engineer careers: know about various areas (ML, DL, NLP, CV) and have a deeper understanding of one specific area, through projects, open-source contributions, research, internships, etc.

### How do you select a position?
* Work with great people on great projects. You are influenced by the people around you, so you want to surround yourself with people that inspire you.
* Focus on the team you'll interact with (10-30/50 people) and make sure to get to know your manager. 
* Do not focus on the brand. 
* Early in your career: learn the most and do important and meaningful work.
